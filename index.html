          <em>Astrum Aurum</em>
          is a science fantasy setting of interstellar adventure coupled with delves of mythic planehopping.
          The goal is to provide broad strokes of setting and plenty of generators for you to flesh out your own piece of the 
          Known Universe. As the goal is setting more than rules, much of this site isn't tied to a rulesystem. However, 
          sometimes rules are necessary to give a better understanding of capability – particularly when it comes to weapons, 
          gear and monsters. The setting has been built up over years, and it is a compilation of numerous rules. 
          I can recommend all of the following rules, and you will find various support for all in the following pages.
